# Workshop 2

Second Secure Web Development workshop.

### Description

The goal was to learn the basics of MongoDB and how to use it with Javascript using the same `.json` file as in workshop 1 as source data.

### How to execute

The code is all inside `import-data.js` and can simply be executed by uncommenting the wanted function and running this command : 
```bash
npm run test1
```

### Contents

The `.env` file only contains the MongoDB credentials in this format :
```json
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<server name>/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
